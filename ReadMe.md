This is my irst rust project, a compiler for a language that is written like plain english!

## Purpose

taking inspiration from old languages like COBOL, i want to make a similar language in order to understand how compilers work, and how
language features are implemented, and also want to learn rust (everyone's doing it, mom, i'll be so cool etc. etc.). 

## Completed Tasks

1. Literally nothing.

## TODO

1. Implement tokenisation.
